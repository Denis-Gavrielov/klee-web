* src/klee_web/api/views.py
    from worker.worker import submit_code
        basically a POST request that will be translated to calling the
        submit_code function
    from worker.worker_config import WorkerConfig
        here only the timeout is needed -> so can get the timeout as an
        api GET.

* control_panel/klee_task.py
    from worker.worker import celery
        instance of celery -> replace this entirely with api GET calls.

* control_panel/views.py
    from worker.worker import celery
        additional stats that need to be exposed via GET
    from worker.worker_config import WorkerConfig
        should be able to do POST and GET, given that the WorkerConfig class
        just adapts the global redis queue
        
* tests/testcase_generate.py
    this will be tricky, need to think about how to rewrite the test.
