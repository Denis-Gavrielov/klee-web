Klee Web
=======================
[Try it out on staging here!](http://178.62.50.142/)

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/klee-web/klee-web.png?style=badge)](https://circleci.com/gh/klee-web/klee-web)
Getting started on development
===============================

Make sure you have [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), and [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) installed.

First clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/klee-web/klee-web.git
    
Start the development virtual machine (this may take a while on the first run):
    vagrant up

After provisioning has completed klee-web will be available at [http://192.168.33.10](http://192.168.33.10)

The [kleeweb/klee](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kleeweb/klee/) image is grabbed using docker pull when provisioning occurs.
If you need to make modifications to the Dockerfile and build it from scratch 
then run the following.

    vagrant ssh
    sudo docker build /titb/python/worker/klee/
    
    
In order to invoke KLEE (from within the virtual machine):

    sudo docker run -t -v PATH_TO_SOURCE_DIR:/code kleeweb/klee llvm-gcc -I /src/klee/include --emit-llvm -c -g /code/FILE.c -o /code/FILE.o
    sudo docker run -t -v PATH_TO_SOURCE_DIR:/code kleeweb/klee klee FILE.o


In order to see any server side changes (from within the virtual machine):

    sudo supervisorctl reload
    

Running tests!
===========================
Before submitting a pull request it's a good idea to run our test suite locally with the following command

    vagrant ssh -c "/titb/run_tests.sh"


Building Frontend
===========================

Make sure you have Node and npm installed.

At the root-level directory:
	
	$ npm install -g bower
	$ npm install -g grunt-cli

Then:
	
	$ npm install

Now that Grunt and Bower are installed, install the front-end packages with

	$ bower install

Finally, let Grunt do the rest of the work (compiling/minifying SASS/JS etc), with

	$ grunt

------

To watch for changes when modifying SASS, use

	$ grunt watch
